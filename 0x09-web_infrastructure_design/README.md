- [Monitoring](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/13)
- [Web Server](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/17)
- [Network basics](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/33)
- [Load balancer](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/46)
- [Server](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/67)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), __without the help of Google:__

### General
- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track project
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

### General
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
- As each task is completed, the name of the task will turn green
- Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) but feel free to use anything you want).
- For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer to Github, insert the file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
- Cover what the requirements that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
- Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked.
